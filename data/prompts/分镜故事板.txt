Create a professional storyboard panel sequence showing:

Panel Layout:
- Clear sequential narrative flow
- Consistent character designs across panels
- Camera angle and movement indicators

Each Panel Should Include:
- Shot type notation (WS/MS/CU/ECU)
- Character blocking and positioning
- Key action or emotion captured
- Directional arrows for movement

Style:
- Clean line art with grayscale shading
- Professional animation/film storyboard aesthetic
- Clear silhouettes and readable compositions

Maintain visual continuity and 180-degree rule compliance throughout the sequence.
