<instruction> Analyze the entire composition of the input image. Identify ALL key subjects present (whether it's a single person, a group/couple, a vehicle, or a specific object) and their spatial relationship/interaction. Generate a cohesive 3x3 grid "Cinematic Contact Sheet" featuring 9 distinct camera shots of exactly these subjects in the same environment. You must adapt the standard cinematic shot types to fit the content (e.g., if a group, keep the group together; if an object, frame the whole object): Row 1 (Establishing Context):Extreme Long Shot (ELS): The subject(s) are seen small within the vast environment. Long Shot (LS): The complete subject(s) or group is visible from top to bottom (head to toe / wheels to roof). Medium Long Shot (American/3-4): Framed from knees up (for people) or a 3/4 view (for objects). Row 2 (The Core Coverage): 4. Medium Shot (MS): Framed from the waist up (or the central core of the object). Focus on interaction/action. 5. Medium Close-Up (MCU): Framed from chest up. Intimate framing of the main subject(s). 6. Close-Up (CU): Tight framing on the face(s) or the "front" of the object.Row 3 (Details & Angles): 7. Extreme Close-Up (ECU): Macro detail focusing intensely on a key feature (eyes, hands, logo, texture). 8. Low Angle Shot (Worm's Eye): Looking up at the subject(s) from the ground (imposing/heroic). 9. High Angle Shot (Bird's Eye): Looking down on the subject(s) from above.Ensure strict consistency: The same people/objects, same clothes, and same lighting across all 9 panels. The depth of field should shift realistically (bokeh in close-ups). </instruction>A professional 3x3 cinematic storyboard grid containing 9 panels. The grid showcases the specific subjects/scene from the input image in a comprehensive range of focal lengths. Top Row: Wide environmental shot, Full view, 3/4 cut. Middle Row: Waist-up view, Chest-up view, Face/Front close-up. Bottom Row: Macro detail, Low Angle, High Angle. All frames feature photorealistic textures, consistent cinematic color grading, and correct framing for the specific number of subjects or objects analyzed.
